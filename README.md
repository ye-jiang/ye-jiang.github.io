## Welcome to Ye Jiang's homepage.

I am a Ph.D student supervised by [Dr.Diana Maynard](http://staffwww.dcs.shef.ac.uk/people/D.Maynard/) in the Department of Computer Science at the [University of Sheffield](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/).

I am interested in using deep learning approaches for text classification, topic generating, and document summarization.
